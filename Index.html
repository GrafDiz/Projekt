            <div class="title">My passion</div>
            I consider myself an artistic soul, always appreciating various forms of art. Since primary school, I have been amazed by digital artists creating both 2D and 3D compositions. I have always seen digital art as an extension of its real-life counterparts. You might wonder how a flat image displayed on a screen could be an extended form of something like a real-life sculpture. However, you can sculpt a human face using a computer and use it in animation software to bring it to life in a short film. The possibilities are endless; you can make your creations dynamic and vibrant. That's why, early on in my education, I decided that digital art is the path I want to pursue in life.
            Since then, I have learned 3D sculpting and modeling, as well as the basics of 3D and 2D animation, and rendering 3D environments. I have gained experience by working on various game projects with my older brother, who is a passionate programmer. While none of these projects has been released yet, we are currently working on an exciting and ambitious project that I'm eagerly looking forward to.    
            Each attempt to create a game or a short animated movie has taught me valuable lessons. It's incredibly thrilling because every project presents its own set of challenges, and you have to find solutions using only a few tools, depending on the type of project you're working on. The satisfaction of overcoming these challenges is truly rewarding.

                Since the early years of my primary school education, I have been learning how to use specialized software and create stunning 3D and 2D art. I am familiar with Photoshop and other well-known software commonly used in the industry. However, my main focus has been on developing my skills in creating 3D art. Blender was the first application I ever used, and to this day, I continue to utilize it. It has become the industry standard, and I feel extremely confident in my ability to create and sculpt inanimate objects. Though I find organic objects slightly more challenging, I am gradually getting accustomed to them. I dedicate a significant amount of time to studying proportions and muscle placement to achieve natural-looking facial sculpting. In my artwork, I try to cultivate my own unique style, which is influenced by some of my favorite video games and movies. As I progress, I have started to experiment with altering proportions to achieve interesting elements in my work.

               I never really liked music as a child. For me, it was always just background noise, and all musicians seemed like a bunch of weird people screaming for attention. My perspective changed between 7th and 8th grade when my older brother introduced me to a band called Green Day. It was a blast! I had never heard such a simple yet powerful combination of electric guitar, bass, and drums. I instantly fell in love with the band and the whole genre of punk rock music. That's how my punk phase began.

In the following months, I became more interested in playing the guitar. A friend of mine had just started playing, and we talked about starting a band together. So, I convinced my parents to buy me my first guitar. It wasn't a classic or acoustic one; I went straight for an electric guitar. My mom thought I would lose interest and leave it in the corner of my room after a few weeks. However, since I got it, I never stopped playing. I never even had proper lessons or met someone who could teach me how to play the guitar. I learned on my own by watching concerts and observing people playing live.

After I learned the first few chords on my guitar, I thought it was the perfect moment to form a band. So, my friend and I started playing together every Sunday at his parents' house, but we never had a chance to perform live. After primary school, we stopped playing together. I never considered myself a good guitar player, and that belief persists to this day, but I felt the urge to try playing with an actual band.

                By the end of 8th grade, I managed to form my very first band called "Burned Out," as a tribute to one of Green Day's songs. We wrote original songs, participated in a talent show, played a few shows, and even recorded our songs, publishing them on YouTube. Unfortunately, Burned Out suddenly broke up, and I couldn't find anything to fill the void left after the breakup. So, I decided to form another band.

                I reached out to all the guitarists I knew at the time and even contacted the drummer from Burned Out. That's how my second band, called Weep, came to be. We played more of a metal style of music. However, after a few months, I left the band because I didn't feel fulfilled writing that kind of music.
                
                After that, I was once again searching for someone to play with. Over the course of a year and a half, I played with many people in my surroundings but never managed to form a band or anything similar. I began losing hope until one evening in November of last year when I received a call. I answered the phone and heard, "I have two girls here with similar music tastes to yours, and they want to play with someone." I was skeptical but excited at the same time. The following week, I arranged a meeting with the girls, and we started playing instantly. We shared the same energy, and during that meeting, we wrote our first song. And that's how my current band, called "PTSD," was born.
                
                Playing more with these girls, my music taste shifted a bit towards grunge music. Bands like Nirvana, Soundgarden, and Alice In Chains became significant inspirations for me. While I was a fan of punk bands, Lena (our drummer) leaned more towards classic rock and nu-metal, and Inga (our bassist) was a huge fan of metal. Grunge turned out to be a perfect middle ground for us, as it incorporated elements from all our favorite genres.
